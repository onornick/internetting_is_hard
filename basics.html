    <h1>Internetting Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>This is how you make an unordered list</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Add a "ul" element (it satnds for unordered list)</li>
        <li>Add each item in it's own "li" element</li>
        <li>They don't need to be in a particular order</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is how you make an ordered list</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Notice the "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
        <li>But, the list item elemets are the same</li>
        <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
        <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because it is an ordered list</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase</p>

    <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase</p>

    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
    <p>Thanks for reading! Internetting should be getting easier now</p>

    <!--Optional Trailing Slash-->
    <p>The trailing slash (/) in all empty HTML elements is entirely optional. The above snippet could also be marked up like this (note the lack of / in the <br> and <hr> tags):</p>
